[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that brings up and maintains userspace services. Separate instances are started for logged-in users to start their services.

       [1msystemd [22mis usually not invoked directly by the user, but is installed as the /sbin/init symlink and started during early boot. The user manager instances are started automatically through the [1muser@.service[22m(5) service.

       When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file system.conf and the files in system.conf.d directories; when run as a user instance, systemd interprets the configuration file user.conf and the files in user.conf.d directories. See [1msystemd-system.conf[22m(5) for more information.

       [1msystemd [22mcontains native implementations of various tasks that need to be executed as part of the boot process. For example, it sets the hostname or configures the loopback network device. It also sets up and mounts various API file systems, such as /sys/, /proc/, and /dev/.

       [1msystemd [22mwill also reset the system clock during early boot if it appears to be set incorrectly. See "System clock epoch" section below.

       Note that some but not all interfaces provided by systemd are covered by the [34m[1mInterface Portability and Stability Promise[0m[1m[22m[1].

       The D-Bus API of [1msystemd [22mis described in [1morg.freedesktop.systemd1[22m(5) and [1morg.freedesktop.LogControl1[22m(5).

       Systems which invoke systemd in a container or initrd environment should implement the [34m[1mContainer Interface[0m[1m[22m[2] or [34m[1minitrd Interface[0m[1m[22m[3] specifications, respectively.

[1mUNITS[0m
       systemd provides a dependency system between various entities called "units" of 11 different types. Units encapsulate various objects that are relevant for system boot-up and maintenance. The majority of units are configured in unit configuration files, whose syntax and basic set of options is described in [1msystemd.unit[22m(5), however some are created automatically from other
       configuration files, dynamically from system state or programmatically at runtime. Units may be in a number of states, described in the following table. Note that the various unit types may have a number of additional substates, which are mapped to the generalized unit states described here.

       The following unit types are available:

        1. Service units, which start and control daemons and the processes they consist of. For details, see [1msystemd.service[22m(5).

        2. Socket units, which encapsulate local IPC or network sockets in the system, useful for socket-based activation. For details about socket units, see [1msystemd.socket[22m(5), for details on socket-based activation and other forms of activation, see [1mdaemon[22m(7).

        3. Target units are useful to group units, or provide well-known synchronization points during boot-up, see [1msystemd.target[22m(5).

        4. Device units expose kernel devices in systemd and may be used to implement device-based activation. For details, see [1msystemd.device[22m(5).

        5. Mount units control mount points in the file system, for details see [1msystemd.mount[22m(5).

        6. Automount units provide automount capabilities, for on-demand mounting of file systems as well as parallelized boot-up. See [1msystemd.automount[22m(5).

        7. Timer units are useful for triggering activation of other units based on timers. You may find details in [1msystemd.timer[22m(5).

        8. Swap units are very similar to mount units and encapsulate memory swap partitions or files of the operating system. They are described in [1msystemd.swap[22m(5).

        9. Path units may be used to activate other services when file system objects change or are modified. See [1msystemd.path[22m(5).

       10. Slice units may be used to group units which manage system processes (such as service and scope units) in a hierarchical tree for resource management purposes. See [1msystemd.slice[22m(5).

       11. Scope units are similar to service units, but manage foreign processes instead of starting them as well. See [1msystemd.scope[22m(5).

       Units are named as their configuration files. Some units have special semantics. A detailed list is available in [1msystemd.special[22m(7).

       systemd knows various kinds of dependencies, including positive and negative requirement dependencies (i.e.  [4mRequires=[24m and [4mConflicts=[24m) as well as ordering dependencies ([4mAfter=[24m and [4mBefore=[24m). NB: ordering and requirement dependencies are orthogonal. If only a requirement dependency exists between two units (e.g.  foo.service requires bar.service), but no ordering dependency
       (e.g.  foo.service after bar.service) and both are requested to start, they will be started in parallel. It is a common pattern that both requirement and ordering dependencies are placed between two units. Also note that the majority of dependencies are implicitly created and maintained by systemd. In most cases, it should be unnecessary to declare additional dependencies
       manually, however it is possible to do this.

       Application programs and units (via dependencies) may request state changes of units. In systemd, these requests are encapsulated as 'jobs' and maintained in a job queue. Jobs may succeed or can fail, their execution is ordered based on the ordering dependencies of the units they have been scheduled for.

       On boot systemd activates the target unit default.target whose job is to activate on-boot services and other on-boot units by pulling them in via dependencies. Usually, the unit name is just an alias (symlink) for either graphical.target (for fully-featured boots into the UI) or multi-user.target (for limited console-only boots for use in embedded or server environments,
       or similar; a subset of graphical.target). However, it is at the discretion of the administrator to configure it as an alias to any other target unit. See [1msystemd.special[22m(7) for details about these target units.

       On first boot, [1msystemd [22mwill enable or disable units according to preset policy. See [1msystemd.preset[22m(5) and "First Boot Semantics" in [1mmachine-id[22m(5).

       systemd only keeps a minimal set of units loaded into memory. Specifically, the only units that are kept loaded into memory are those for which at least one of the following conditions is true:

        1. It is in an active, activating, deactivating or failed state (i.e. in any unit state except for "inactive")

        2. It has a job queued for it

        3. It is a dependency of at least one other unit that is loaded into memory

        4. It has some form of resource still allocated (e.g. a service unit that is inactive but for which a process is still lingering that ignored the request to be terminated)

        5. It has been pinned into memory programmatically by a D-Bus call

       systemd will automatically and implicitly load units from disk — if they are not loaded yet — as soon as operations are requested for them. Thus, in many respects, the fact whether a unit is loaded or not is invisible to clients. Use [1msystemctl list-units --all [22mto comprehensively list all units currently loaded. Any unit for which none of the conditions above applies is
       promptly unloaded. Note that when a unit is unloaded from memory its accounting data is flushed out too. However, this data is generally not lost, as a journal log record is generated declaring the consumed resources whenever a unit shuts down.

       Processes systemd spawns are placed in individual Linux control groups named after the unit which they belong to in the private systemd hierarchy. (see [34m[1mControl Groups v2[0m[1m[22m[4] for more information about control groups, or short "cgroups"). systemd uses this to effectively keep track of processes. Control group information is maintained in the kernel, and is accessible via
       the file system hierarchy (beneath /sys/fs/cgroup/), or in tools such as [1msystemd-cgls[22m(1) or [1mps[22m(1) ([1mps xawf -eo pid,user,cgroup,args [22mis particularly useful to list all processes and the systemd units they belong to.).

       systemd is compatible with various established Unix functionality such as /etc/fstab or the utmp database.

       systemd has a minimal transaction system: if a unit is requested to start up or shut down it will add it and all its dependencies to a temporary transaction. Then, it will verify if the transaction is consistent (i.e. whether the ordering of all units is cycle-free). If it is not, systemd will try to fix it up, and removes non-essential jobs from the transaction that
       might remove the loop. Also, systemd tries to suppress non-essential jobs in the transaction that would stop a running service. Finally it is checked whether the jobs of the transaction contradict jobs that have already been queued, and optionally the transaction is aborted then. If all worked out and the transaction is consistent and minimized in its impact it is merged
       with all already outstanding jobs and added to the run queue. Effectively this means that before executing a requested operation, systemd will verify that it makes sense, fixing it if possible, and only failing if it really cannot work.

       Note that transactions are generated independently of a unit's state at runtime, hence, for example, if a start job is requested on an already started unit, it will still generate a transaction and wake up any inactive dependencies (and cause propagation of other jobs as per the defined relationships). This is because the enqueued job is at the time of execution compared
       to the target unit's state and is marked successful and complete when both satisfy. However, this job also pulls in other dependencies due to the defined relationships and thus leads to, in our example, start jobs for any of those inactive units getting queued as well.

       Units may be generated dynamically at boot and system manager reload time, for example based on other configuration files or parameters passed on the kernel command line. For details, see [1msystemd.generator[22m(7).

[1mDIRECTORIES[0m
       System unit directories
           The systemd system manager reads unit configuration from various directories. Packages that want to install unit files shall place them in the directory returned by [1mpkg-config systemd --variable=systemdsystemunitdir[22m. Other directories checked are /usr/local/lib/systemd/system and /usr/lib/systemd/system. User configuration always takes precedence.  [1mpkg-config systemd[0m
           [1m--variable=systemdsystemconfdir [22mreturns the path of the system configuration directory. Packages should alter the content of these directories only with the [1menable [22mand [1mdisable [22mcommands of the [1msystemctl[22m(1) tool. Full list of directories is provided in [1msystemd.unit[22m(5).

       User unit directories
           Similar rules apply for the user unit directories. However, here the [34m[1mXDG Base Directory specification[0m[1m[22m[5] is followed to find units. Applications should place their unit files in the directory returned by [1mpkg-config systemd --variable=systemduserunitdir[22m. Global configuration is done in the directory reported by [1mpkg-config systemd --variable=systemduserconfdir[22m. The
           [1menable [22mand [1mdisable [22mcommands of the [1msystemctl[22m(1) tool can handle both global (i.e. for all users) and private (for one user) enabling/disabling of units. Full list of directories is provided in [1msystemd.unit[22m(5).

[1mSIGNALS[0m
       The service listens to various UNIX process signals that can be used to request various actions asynchronously. The signal handling is enabled very early during boot, before any further processes are invoked. However, a supervising container manager or similar that intends to request these operations via this mechanism must take into consideration that this functionality
       is not available during the earliest initialization phase. An [1msd_notify() [22mnotification message carrying the [4mX_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=2[24m field is emitted once the signal handlers are enabled, see below. This may be used to schedule submission of these signals correctly.

       [1mSIGTERM[0m
           Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager serializes its state, reexecutes itself and deserializes the saved state again. This is mostly equivalent to [1msystemctl daemon-reexec[22m.

           systemd user managers will start the exit.target unit when this signal is received. This is mostly equivalent to [1msystemctl --user start exit.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly[22m.

       [1mSIGINT[0m
           Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager will start the ctrl-alt-del.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to [1msystemctl start ctrl-alt-del.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly[22m. If this signal is received more than 7 times per 2s, an immediate reboot is triggered. Note that pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del on the console will trigger this signal. Hence, if a
           reboot is hanging, pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del more than 7 times in 2 seconds is a relatively safe way to trigger an immediate reboot.

           systemd user managers treat this signal the same way as [1mSIGTERM[22m.

       [1mSIGWINCH[0m
           When this signal is received the systemd system manager will start the kbrequest.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to [1msystemctl start kbrequest.target[22m.

           This signal is ignored by systemd user managers.

       [1mSIGPWR[0m
           When this signal is received the systemd manager will start the sigpwr.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to [1msystemctl start sigpwr.target[22m.

       [1mSIGUSR1[0m
           When this signal is received the systemd manager will try to reconnect to the D-Bus bus.

       [1mSIGUSR2[0m
           When this signal is received the systemd manager will log its complete state in human-readable form. The data logged is the same as printed by [1msystemd-analyze dump[22m.

           Sets the log target to "console" on [1mSIGRTMIN+27 [22m(or "kmsg" on [1mSIGRTMIN+28[22m), in a fashion equivalent to [4msystemd.log_target=console[24m (or [4msystemd.log_target=kmsg[24m on [1mSIGRTMIN+28[22m) on the kernel command line.

           Added in version 239.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       The environment block for the system manager is initially set by the kernel. (In particular, "key=value" assignments on the kernel command line are turned into environment variables for PID 1). For the user manager, the system manager sets the environment as described in the "Environment Variables in Spawned Processes" section of [1msystemd.exec[22m(5). The [4mDefaultEnvironment=[0m
       setting in the system manager applies to all services including user@.service. Additional entries may be configured (as for any other service) through the [4mEnvironment=[24m and [4mEnvironmentFile=[24m settings for user@.service (see [1msystemd.exec[22m(5)). Also, additional environment variables may be set through the [4mManagerEnvironment=[24m setting in [1msystemd-system.conf[22m(5) and [1msystemd-[0m
       [1muser.conf[22m(5).

       Some of the variables understood by [1msystemd[22m:

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL[0m
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in order of decreasing importance) [1memerg[22m, [1malert[22m, [1mcrit[22m, [1merr[22m, [1mwarning[22m, [1mnotice[22m, [1minfo[22m, [1mdebug[22m, or an integer in the range 0...7. See [1msyslog[22m(3) for more information. Each value may
           optionally be prefixed with one of [1mconsole[22m, [1msyslog[22m, [1mkmsg [22mor [1mjournal [22mfollowed by a colon to set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.  [1mSYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info [22mspecifies to log at debug level except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note that the global maximum log level takes priority over any per target maximum
           log levels.

           This can be overridden with [1m--log-level=[22m.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR[0m
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority.

           This can be overridden with [1m--log-color=[22m.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME[0m
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a timestamp.

           This can be overridden with [1m--log-time=[22m.

           Added in version 246.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION[0m
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code where the message originates.

           This can be overridden with [1m--log-location=[22m.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID[0m
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Added in version 247.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET[0m
           The destination for log messages. One of [1mconsole [22m(log to the attached tty), [1mconsole-prefixed [22m(log to the attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see [1msyslog[22m(3), [1mkmsg [22m(log to the kernel circular log buffer), [1mjournal [22m(log to the journal), [1mjournal-or-kmsg [22m(log to the journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), [1mauto [22m(determine the
           appropriate log target automatically, the default), [1mnull [22m(disable log output).

           This can be overridden with [1m--log-target=[22m.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG[0m
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to "true". If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages written to kmsg.

           Added in version 254.

       [4m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME[24m, [4m$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS[24m, [4m$XDG_DATA_HOME[24m, [4m$XDG_DATA_DIRS[0m
           The systemd user manager uses these variables in accordance to the [34m[1mXDG Base Directory specification[0m[1m[22m[5] to find its configuration.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH[24m, [4m$SYSTEMD_GENERATOR_PATH[24m, [4m$SYSTEMD_ENVIRONMENT_GENERATOR_PATH[0m
           Controls where systemd looks for unit files and generators.

           These variables may contain a list of paths, separated by colons (":"). When set, if the list ends with an empty component ("...:"), this list is prepended to the usual set of paths. Otherwise, the specified list replaces the usual set of paths.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGER[24m, [4m$PAGER[0m
           Pager to use when [1m--no-pager [22mis not given.  [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGER[24m is used if set; otherwise [4m$PAGER[24m is used. If neither [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGER[24m nor [4m$PAGER[24m are set, a set of well-known pager implementations is tried in turn, including [1mless[22m(1) and [1mmore[22m(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered, no pager is invoked. Setting those environment variables to an empty
           string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing [1m--no-pager[22m.

           Note: if [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE[24m is not set, [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGER[24m and [4m$PAGER[24m can only be used to disable the pager (with "cat" or ""), and are otherwise ignored.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LESS[0m
           Override the options passed to [1mless [22m(by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           [1mK[0m
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow [1mless [22mto handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.

               If the value of [4m$SYSTEMD_LESS[24m does not include "K", and the pager that is invoked is [1mless[22m, Ctrl+C will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           [1mX[0m
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in the terminal even after the pager exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular [4m$LESS[24m environment variable has no effect for [1mless [22minvocations by systemd tools.

           See [1mless[22m(1) for more discussion.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET[0m
           Override the charset passed to [1mless [22m(by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular [4m$LESSCHARSET[24m environment variable has no effect for [1mless [22minvocations by systemd tools.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE[0m
           Common pager commands like [1mless[22m(1), in addition to "paging", i.e. scrolling through the output, support opening of or writing to other files and running arbitrary shell commands. When commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under [1msudo[22m(8) or [1mpkexec[22m(1), the pager becomes a security boundary. Care must be taken that only programs with strictly limited
           functionality are used as pagers, and unintended interactive features like opening or creation of new files or starting of subprocesses are not allowed. "Secure mode" for the pager may be enabled as described below, [4mif[24m [4mthe[24m [4mpager[24m [4msupports[24m [4mthat[24m (most pagers are not written in a way that takes this into consideration). It is recommended to either explicitly enable
           "secure mode" or to completely disable the pager using [1m--no-pager [22mor [4mPAGER=cat[24m when allowing untrusted users to execute commands with elevated privileges.

           This option takes a boolean argument. When set to true, the "secure mode" of the pager is enabled. In "secure mode", [1mLESSSECURE=1 [22mwill be set when invoking the pager, which instructs the pager to disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. Currently only [1mless[22m(1) is known to understand this variable and implement "secure mode".

           When set to false, no limitation is placed on the pager. Setting [4mSYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0[24m or not removing it from the inherited environment may allow the user to invoke arbitrary commands.

           When [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE[24m is not set, systemd tools attempt to automatically figure out if "secure mode" should be enabled and whether the pager supports it. "Secure mode" is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see [1mgeteuid[22m(2) and [1msd_pid_get_owner_uid[22m(3), or when running under [1msudo[22m(8) or similar tools ([4m$SUDO_UID[24m is set [6]).
           In those cases, [4mSYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=1[24m will be set and pagers which are not known to implement "secure mode" will not be used at all. Note that this autodetection only covers the most common mechanisms to elevate privileges and is intended as convenience. It is recommended to explicitly set [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE[24m or disable the pager.

           Note that if the [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGER[24m or [4m$PAGER[24m variables are to be honoured, other than to disable the pager, [4m$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE[24m must be set too.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_COLORS[0m
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, [1msystemd [22mand related utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors, respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on
           [4m$TERM[24m and what the console is connected to.

       [4m$SYSTEMD_URLIFY[0m
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that [1msystemd [22mmakes based on [4m$TERM[24m and other conditions.

       [4m$LISTEN_PID[24m, [4m$LISTEN_FDS[24m, [4m$LISTEN_FDNAMES[0m
           Set by systemd for supervised processes during socket-based activation. See [1msd_listen_fds[22m(3) for more information.

       [4m$NOTIFY_SOCKET[0m
           Set by service manager for its services for status and readiness notifications. Also consumed by service manager for notifying supervising container managers or service managers up the stack about its own progress. See [1msd_notify[22m(3) and the relevant section below for more information.

       For further environment variables understood by systemd and its various components, see [34m[1mKnown Environment Variables[0m[1m[22m[7].

[1mKERNEL COMMAND LINE[0m
       When run as the system instance, systemd parses a number of options listed below. They can be specified as kernel command line arguments which are parsed from a number of sources depending on the environment in which systemd is executed. If run inside a Linux container, these options are parsed from the command line arguments passed to systemd itself, next to any of the
       command line options listed in the Options section above. If run outside of Linux containers, these arguments are parsed from /proc/cmdline instead.

       The following variables are understood:

       [4msystemd.unit=[24m, [4mrd.systemd.unit=[0m
           Overrides the unit to activate on boot. Defaults to default.target. This may be used to temporarily boot into a different boot unit, for example rescue.target or emergency.service. See [1msystemd.special[22m(7) for details about these units. The option prefixed with "rd."  is honored only in the initrd, while the one that is not prefixed only in the main system.

       [4msystemd.dump_core[0m
           Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified without an argument. If enabled, the systemd manager (PID 1) dumps core when it crashes. Otherwise, no core dump is created. Defaults to enabled.

           Added in version 233.

       [4msystemd.crash_chvt[0m
           Takes a positive integer, or a boolean argument. Can be also specified without an argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean. If a positive integer (in the range 1–63) is specified, the system manager (PID 1) will activate the specified virtual terminal when it crashes. Defaults to disabled, meaning that no such switch is attempted. If set to enabled, the
           virtual terminal the kernel messages are written to is used instead.

           Added in version 233.

       [4msystemd.crash_shell[0m
           Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified without an argument. If enabled, the system manager (PID 1) spawns a shell when it crashes. Otherwise, no shell is spawned. Defaults to disabled, for security reasons, as the shell is not protected by password authentication.

           Added in version 233.

       [4msystemd.crash_action=[0m
           Takes one of "freeze", "reboot" or "poweroff". Defaults to "freeze". If set to "freeze", the system will hang indefinitely when the system manager (PID 1) crashes. If set to "reboot", the system manager (PID 1) will reboot the machine automatically when it crashes, after a 10s delay. If set to "poweroff", the system manager (PID 1) will power off the machine
           immediately when it crashes. If combined with [4msystemd.crash_shell[24m, the configured crash action is executed after the shell exits.

           Added in version 256.

       [4msystemd.confirm_spawn[0m
           Takes a boolean argument or a path to the virtual console where the confirmation messages should be emitted. Can be also specified without an argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean. If enabled, the system manager (PID 1) asks for confirmation when spawning processes using [1m/dev/console[22m. If a path or a console name (such as "ttyS0") is provided, the
           virtual console pointed to by this path or described by the give name will be used instead. Defaults to disabled.

           Added in version 233.

       [4msystemd.service_watchdogs=[0m
           Takes a boolean argument. If disabled, all service runtime watchdogs ([1mWatchdogSec=[22m) and emergency actions (e.g.  [1mOnFailure= [22mor [1mStartLimitAction=[22m) are ignored by the system manager (PID 1); see [1msystemd.service[22m(5). Defaults to enabled, i.e. watchdogs and failure actions are processed normally. The hardware watchdog is not affected by this option.

           Added in version 237.

       [4msystemd.show_status[0m
           Takes a boolean argument or the constants [1merror [22mand [1mauto[22m. Can be also specified without an argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean. If enabled, the systemd manager (PID 1) shows terse service status updates on the console during bootup. With [1merror[22m, only messages about failures are shown, but boot is otherwise quiet.  [1mauto [22mbehaves like [1mfalse [22muntil there is
           a significant delay in boot. Defaults to enabled, unless [1mquiet [22mis passed as kernel command line option, in which case it defaults to [1merror[22m. If specified overrides the system manager configuration file option [1mShowStatus=[22m, see [1msystemd-system.conf[22m(5).

           Added in version 233.

       [4msystemd.status_unit_format=[0m
           Takes [1mname[22m, [1mdescription [22mor [1mcombined [22mas the value. If [1mname[22m, the system manager will use unit names in status messages. If [1mcombined[22m, the system manager will use unit names and description in status messages. When specified, overrides the system manager configuration file option [1mStatusUnitFormat=[22m, see [1msystemd-system.conf[22m(5).

           Added in version 243.

       [4msystemd.log_color[24m, [4msystemd.log_level=[24m, [4msystemd.log_location[24m, [4msystemd.log_target=[24m, [4msystemd.log_time[24m, [4msystemd.log_tid[24m, [4msystemd.log_ratelimit_kmsg[0m
           Controls log output, with the same effect as the [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR[24m, [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL[24m, [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION[24m, [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET[24m, [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME[24m, [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID[24m and [4m$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG[24m environment variables described above.  [4msystemd.log_color[24m, [4msystemd.log_location[24m, [4msystemd.log_time[24m, [4msystemd.log_tid[24m and [4msystemd.log_ratelimit_kmsg[24m can be specified
           without an argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean.

       [4msystemd.default_standard_output=[24m, [4msystemd.default_standard_error=[0m
           Controls default standard output and error output for services and sockets. That is, controls the default for [1mStandardOutput= [22mand [1mStandardError= [22m(see [1msystemd.exec[22m(5) for details). Takes one of [1minherit[22m, [1mnull[22m, [1mtty[22m, [1mjournal[22m, [1mjournal+console[22m, [1mkmsg[22m, [1mkmsg+console[22m. If the argument is omitted [4msystemd.default-standard-output=[24m defaults to [1mjournal [22mand
           [4msystemd.default-standard-error=[24m to [1minherit[22m.

       [4msystemd.setenv=[0m
           Takes a string argument in the form VARIABLE=VALUE. May be used to set default environment variables to add to forked child processes. May be used more than once to set multiple variables.

       [4msystemd.machine_id=[0m
           Takes a 32 character hex value to be used for setting the machine-id. Intended mostly for network booting where the same machine-id is desired for every boot.

           Added in version 229.

       [4msystemd.set_credential=[24m, [4msystemd.set_credential_binary=[0m
           Sets a system credential, which can then be propagated to system services using the [4mImportCredential=[24m or [4mLoadCredential=[24m setting, see [1msystemd.exec[22m(5) for details. Takes a pair of credential name and value, separated by a colon. The [4msystemd.set_credential=[24m parameter expects the credential value in literal text form, the [4msystemd.set_credential_binary=[24m parameter takes
           binary data encoded in Base64. Note that the kernel command line is typically accessible by unprivileged programs in /proc/cmdline. Thus, this mechanism is not suitable for transferring sensitive data. Use it only for data that is not sensitive (e.g. public keys/certificates, rather than private keys), or in testing/debugging environments.

           For further information see [34m[1mSystem and Service Credentials[0m[1m[22m[8] documentation.

           Added in version 251.

       [4msystemd.import_credentials=[0m
           Takes a boolean argument. If false disables importing credentials from the kernel command line, the DMI/SMBIOS OEM string table, the qemu_fw_cfg subsystem or the EFI kernel stub.

           Added in version 251.

       [4mquiet[0m
           Turn off status output at boot, much like [4msystemd.show_status=no[24m would. Note that this option is also read by the kernel itself and disables kernel log output. Passing this option hence turns off the usual output from both the system manager and the kernel.

           Added in version 186.

       [4mdebug[0m
           Turn on debugging output. This is equivalent to [4msystemd.log_level=debug[24m. Note that this option is also read by the kernel itself and enables kernel debug output. Passing this option hence turns on the debug output from both the system manager and the kernel.

           Added in version 205.

       [4memergency[24m, [4mrd.emergency[24m, [4m-b[0m
           Boot into emergency mode. This is equivalent to [4msystemd.unit=emergency.target[24m or [4mrd.systemd.unit=emergency.target[24m, respectively, and provided for compatibility reasons and to be easier to type.

           Added in version 186.

       [4mrescue[24m, [4mrd.rescue[24m, [4msingle[24m, [4ms[24m, [4mS[24m, [4m1[0m
           Boot into rescue mode. This is equivalent to [4msystemd.unit=rescue.target[24m or [4mrd.systemd.unit=rescue.target[24m, respectively, and provided for compatibility reasons and to be easier to type.

           Added in version 186.

       [4m2[24m, [4m3[24m, [4m4[24m, [4m5[0m

[1mSYSTEM CREDENTIALS[0m
       During initialization the service manager will import credentials from various sources into the system's set of credentials, which can then be propagated into services and consumed by generators:

       •   When the service manager first initializes it will read system credentials from SMBIOS Type 11 vendor strings [4mio.systemd.credential:name=value[24m, and [4mio.systemd.credential.binary:name=value[24m.

       •   At the same time it will import credentials from QEMU "fw_cfg". (Note that the SMBIOS mechanism is generally preferred, because it is faster and generic.)

       •   Credentials may be passed via the kernel command line, using the [4msystemd.set-credential=[24m parameter, see above.

       •   Credentials may be passed from the UEFI environment via [1msystemd-stub[22m(7).

       •   When the service manager is invoked during the initrd → host transition it will import all files in /run/credentials/@initrd/ as system credentials.

       Invoke [1msystemd-creds[22m(1) as follows to see the list of credentials passed into the system:

           # systemd-creds --system list

       For further information see [34m[1mSystem and Service Credentials[0m[1m[22m[8] documentation.

       The service manager when run as PID 1 consumes the following system credentials:

       [4mvmm.notify_socket[0m
           Contains a [1mAF_VSOCK [22mor [1mAF_UNIX [22maddress where to send a [1mREADY=1 [22mnotification message when the service manager has completed booting. See [1msd_notify[22m(3) and the next section for more information. Note that in case the hypervisor does not support [1mSOCK_DGRAM [22mover [1mAF_VSOCK[22m, [1mSOCK_SEQPACKET [22mwill be tried instead. The credential payload for [1mAF_VSOCK [22mshould be a string in the
           form "vsock:CID:PORT".  "vsock-stream", "vsock-dgram" and "vsock-seqpacket" can be used instead of "vsock" to force usage of the corresponding socket type.

           This feature is useful for machine managers or other processes on the host to receive a notification via VSOCK when a virtual machine has finished booting.

           Added in version 254.

       [4msystem.machine_id[0m
           Takes a 128bit hexadecimal ID to initialize /etc/machine-id from, if the file is not set up yet. See [1mmachine-id[22m(5) for details.

           Added in version 254.

       For a list of system credentials various other components of systemd consume, see [1msystemd.system-credentials[22m(7).

[1mREADINESS PROTOCOL[0m
       The service manager implements a readiness notification protocol both between the manager and its services (i.e. down the stack), and between the manager and a potential supervisor further up the stack (the latter could be a machine or container manager, or in case of a per-user service manager the system service manager instance). The basic protocol (and the suggested
       API for it) is described in [1msd_notify[22m(3).

       The notification socket the service manager (including PID 1) uses for reporting readiness to its own supervisor is set via the usual [4m$NOTIFY_SOCKET[24m environment variable (see above). Since this is directly settable only for container managers and for the per-user instance of the service manager, an additional mechanism to configure this is available, in particular
       intended for use in VM environments: the [4mvmm.notify_socket[24m system credential (see above) may be set to a suitable socket (typically an [1mAF_VSOCK [22mone) via SMBIOS Type 11 vendor strings. For details see above.

       The notification protocol from the service manager up the stack towards a supervisor supports a number of extension fields that allow a supervisor to learn about specific properties of the system and track its boot progress. Specifically the following fields are sent:

       •   An [4mX_SYSTEMD_HOSTNAME=...[24m  message will be sent out once the initial hostname for the system has been determined. Note that during later runtime the hostname might be changed again programmatically, and (currently) no further notifications are sent out in that case.

           Added in version 256.

       •   An [4mX_SYSTEMD_MACHINE_ID=...[24m  message will be sent out once the machine ID of the system has been determined. See [1mmachine-id[22m(5) for details.

           Added in version 256.

       •   An [4mX_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=...[24m  message will be sent out once the service manager installed the various UNIX process signal handlers described above. The field's value is an unsigned integer formatted as decimal string, and indicates the supported UNIX process signal feature level of the service manager. Currently, only a single feature level is defined:

           •   [4mX_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=2[24m covers the various UNIX process signals documented above – which are a superset of those supported by the historical SysV init system.

           Signals sent to PID 1 before this message is sent might not be handled correctly yet. A consumer of these messages should parse the value as an unsigned integer that indicates the level of support. For now only the mentioned level 2 is defined, but later on additional levels might be defined with higher integers, that will implement a superset of the currently defined
           behaviour.

           Added in version 256.

       •   [4mX_SYSTEMD_UNIT_ACTIVE=...[24m  and [4mX_SYSTEMD_UNIT_INACTIVE=...[24m  messages will be sent out for each target unit as it becomes active or stops being active. This is useful to track boot progress and functionality. For example, once the ssh-access.target unit is reported started SSH access is typically available, see [1msystemd.special[22m(7) for details.

           Added in version 256.

       •   An [4mX_SYSTEMD_SHUTDOWN=...[24m  message will be sent out very shortly before the system shuts down. The value is one of the strings "reboot", "halt", "poweroff", "kexec" and indicates which kind of shutdown is being executed.

           Added in version 256.

       •   An [4mX_SYSTEMD_REBOOT_PARAMETER=...[24m  message will also be sent out very shortly before the system shuts down. Its value is the reboot argument as configured with [1msystemctl --reboot-argument=...[22m.

           Added in version 256.

       Note that these extension fields are sent in addition to the regular "READY=1" and "RELOADING=1" notifications.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1msystemd [22mis only very rarely invoked directly, since it is started early and is already running by the time users may interact with it. Normally, tools like [1msystemctl[22m(1) are used to give commands to the manager. Since [1msystemd [22mis usually not invoked directly, the options listed below are mostly useful for debugging and special purposes.

   [1mIntrospection and debugging options[0m
       Those options are used for testing and introspection, and [1msystemd [22mmay be invoked with them at any time:

       [1m--dump-configuration-items[0m
           Dump understood unit configuration items. This outputs a terse but complete list of configuration items understood in unit definition files.

       [1m--dump-bus-properties[0m
           Dump exposed bus properties. This outputs a terse but complete list of properties exposed on D-Bus.

           Added in version 239.

       [1m--test[0m
           Determine the initial start-up transaction (i.e. the list of jobs enqueued at start-up), dump it and exit — without actually executing any of the determined jobs. This option is useful for debugging only. Note that during regular service manager start-up additional units not shown by this operation may be started, because hardware, socket, bus or other kinds of
           activation might add additional jobs as the transaction is executed. Use [1m--system [22mto request the initial transaction of the system service manager (this is also the implied default), combine with [1m--user [22mto request the initial transaction of the per-user service manager instead.

       [1m--system[22m, [1m--user[0m
           When used in conjunction with [1m--test[22m, selects whether to calculate the initial transaction for the system instance or for a per-user instance. These options have no effect when invoked without [1m--test[22m, as during regular (i.e. non-[1m--test[22m) invocations the service manager will automatically detect whether it shall operate in system or per-user mode, by checking whether
           the PID it is run as is 1 or not. Note that it is not supported booting and maintaining a system with the service manager running in [1m--system [22mmode but with a PID other than 1.

       [1m-h[22m, [1m--help[0m
           Print a short help text and exit.

       [1m--version[0m
           Print a short version string and exit.

   [1mOptions that duplicate kernel command line settings[0m
       Those options correspond directly to options listed above in "Kernel Command Line". Both forms may be used equivalently for the system manager, but it is recommended to use the forms listed above in this context, because they are properly namespaced. When an option is specified both on the kernel command line and as a normal command line argument, the latter has higher
       precedence.

       When [1msystemd [22mis used as a user manager, the kernel command line is ignored and only the options described below are understood. Nevertheless, [1msystemd [22mis usually started in this mode through the [1muser@.service[22m(5) service, which is shared between all users. It may be more convenient to use configuration files to modify settings (see [1msystemd-user.conf[22m(5)), or environment
       variables. See the "Environment" section above for a discussion of how the environment block is set.

       [1m--unit=[0m
           Set default unit to activate on startup. If not specified, defaults to default.target. See [4msystemd.unit=[24m above.

       [1m--dump-core[0m
           Enable core dumping on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user instance. Same as [4msystemd.dump_core=[24m above.

       [1m--crash-vt=[4m[22mVT[0m
           Switch to a specific virtual console (VT) on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user instance. Same as [4msystemd.crash_chvt=[24m above (but not the different spelling!).

           Added in version 227.

       [1m--crash-shell[0m
           Run a shell on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user instance. See [4msystemd.crash_shell=[24m above.

       [1m--crash-action=[0m
           Specify what to do when the system manager (PID 1) crashes. This switch has no effect when [1msystemd [22mis running as user instance. See [4msystemd.crash_action=[24m above.

           Added in version 256.

       [1m--confirm-spawn[0m
           Ask for confirmation when spawning processes. This switch has no effect when run as user instance. See [4msystemd.confirm_spawn[24m above.

       [1m--show-status[0m
           Show terse unit status information on the console during boot-up and shutdown. See [4msystemd.show_status[24m above.

           Added in version 244.

       [1m--log-color[0m
           Highlight important log messages. See [4msystemd.log_color[24m above.

           Added in version 244.

       [1m--log-level=[0m
           Set log level. See [4msystemd.log_level[24m above.

       [1m--log-location[0m
           Include code location in log messages. See [4msystemd.log_location[24m above.

           Added in version 244.

       [1m--log-target=[0m
           Set log target. See [4msystemd.log_target[24m above.

       [1m--log-time=[0m
           Prefix console messages with timestamp. See [4msystemd.log_time[24m above.

           Added in version 246.

       [1m--machine-id=[0m
           Override the machine-id set on the hard drive. See [4msystemd.machine_id=[24m above.

           Added in version 229.

       [1m--service-watchdogs[0m
           Globally enable/disable all service watchdog timeouts and emergency actions. See [4msystemd.service_watchdogs[24m above.

           Added in version 237.

       [1m--default-standard-output=[22m, [1m--default-standard-error=[0m
           Sets the default output or error output for all services and sockets, respectively. See [4msystemd.default_standard_output=[24m and [4msystemd.default_standard_error=[24m above.

[1mSYSTEM CLOCK EPOCH[0m
       When [1msystemd [22mis started or restarted, it may set the system clock to the "epoch". This mechanism is used to ensure that the system clock remains somewhat reasonably initialized and roughly monotonic across reboots, in case no battery-backed local RTC is available or it does not work correctly.

       The epoch is the lowest date above which the system clock time is assumed to be set correctly. When initializing, the local clock is [4madvanced[24m to the epoch if it was set to a lower value. As a special case, if the local clock is sufficiently far in the future (by default 15 years, but this can be configured at build time), the hardware clock is assumed to be broken, and
       the system clock is [4mrewound[24m to the epoch.

       The epoch is set to the highest of: the build time of systemd, the modification time ("mtime") of /usr/lib/clock-epoch, and the modification time of /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock.

[1mFILES[0m
       /run/systemd/notify
           Daemon status notification socket. This is an [1mAF_UNIX [22mdatagram socket and is used to implement the daemon notification logic as implemented by [1msd_notify[22m(3).

       /run/systemd/private
           Used internally as communication channel between [1msystemctl[22m(1) and the systemd process. This is an [1mAF_UNIX [22mstream socket. This interface is private to systemd and should not be used in external projects.

       /usr/lib/clock-epoch
           The modification time ("mtime") of this file is used for the time epoch, see previous section.

           Added in version 247.

       /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock
           The modification time ("mtime") of this file is updated by [1msystemd-timesyncd.service[22m(8). If present, the modification time of file is used for the epoch, see previous section.

           Added in version 257.
